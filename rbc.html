        <h2>üè¶ Development Intern at RBC </h2>
        <p>The summer after 10th grade I interned at the Royal Bank of Canada for their Connect team. RBC Connect is the bank‚Äôs intranet/digital collaboration software. My manager knew how entrepreneurial I was so she gave me the chance to brainstorm problems about the software and develop a solution for it as my one month project.
        </p>

        <p><strong>The main tasks I worked on during this internship was:
            </strong></p>
        <li>
            <ul>Redesigning the user interface of their help and support pages to make them more user-friendly for new hires</ul>
            <ul>Developing an initiative to get more teams to adopt the software</ul>
            <ul>Creating tutorial videos</ul>
            <ul>Blogging about my experience there</ul>
        </li>

        <h3>üíª Redesigning the user interface</h3>

        <img src="images/animal-mission.png">
        <p>Game development has always been interesting to me! In my spare time, I brainstorm branching stories on Episode Interactive
            and sketch out designs for characters. I got involved after learning about the Google Change the Game Design
            Challenge in 2018 and submitted some of my work. I was highlighted as an honourable mention out of several submissions
            from all over North America. </p>

        <p>This was an awesome experience not only getting the chance to go to the West Coast for the first time but being able
            to inspire young girls and reduce the gender gap in the gaming industry is amazing. This was a great chance for
            me to give back as a mentor for these girls who are already changing the game.</p>

        <h3>ü§î What I learned:</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>üîç The importance of accessibility and focusing on the end user</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Digital products like games are used by a range of people, as young as five or six years-old. It's incredible how
            game designers and console developers were able to ergonomically create a product that lets anyone play.

        <p>
            <strong>üí¨ Communication</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Technology is hard. Some kids were so new to computers they didn't know how to right click. My role as a mentor was
            to introduce them to technology in a positive light and foster an environment that inspired innovation. Patience
            and communication were key. I had to make using game engine simple for kids and break instructions down. I needed
            to realize I'm not explaining things to myself and think about learning in a new perspective. Empathy was important
            to make game development fun for kids. At the end of the camp, I was so proud my students were excited to code
            again and continue their journey in technology.</p>

        <p>
            <strong>ü§© Product management and leadership</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Building a game out within 3 weeks is no easy feat. These 7 year-olds are very ambitious with their ideas. Saying
            no to them was one one of the hardest things to do, because they want to believe anything is possible. In reality,
            some things just can't be achieved in so little time. I gained product management skills by leading the ideation
            stage, setting a scope for the project, and setting milestones for the game to complete it in time. I also had
            to ensure my girls were motivated. - Dealing with bugs at such a young age is not fun, especially when some bugs
            caused them to lose all their work. I learned essential leadership skills and encouraged my team when times were
            tough. </p>

        <p>These girls are changing the game! I learned that accessible game design is something I'd love to explore in the
            future.üíØ</p>
