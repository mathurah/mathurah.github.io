		<h2>ü§î The Problem</h2>
		<img style="width: 350px;" class="rows" src="images/inaccessibility.png">
		<img style="width: 350px;" class="rows" src="images/complicated.png">
		<p>The two main problems this product solves is the
			<strong>inaccessibility</strong> of the blockchain industry and the
			<strong>complicated purchasing process</strong>. Young students are left in the dark because they lack sufficient funds to invest,
			can't learn without risking, and they have to be over 18 to invest.</p>
		<p>I identified this problem after doing market research with a survey of over 500 students in Toronto. We then gathered a
			small sample size to do user interviews in person to finally define the problem space.</p>
		<p>I turned our question into
			<strong>How Might We Make Cryptocurrency easy, fun, and accessible for Gen Z?</strong>
		</p>

		<h2>üí≠ The process</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>It took a lot of sticky notes to make this happen.</strong>
		</p>
		<img src="images/ideation.png">

		<p>
			<strong>And whiteboarding.</strong>
		</p>
		<img src="images/whiteboarding.jpg">

		<p>I started off leading my team at design sprints, where we whitebaorded our design ideas, synthesized, and prioritzed features
			for version 1. As head of product, I created a roadmap of features that were feasible to build. I presented my work at
			weekly standups.</p>

		<p>I managed team communication on Slack and Trello, ensuring everything was transparent. We were really a product family!
			</p>

		<p>On the dev side when we were testing our beta version, I created a process on Trello for bug reporting.</p>
