            <p>Hey! I'm Mathurah. I'm a
                <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/systems-design-engineering/">Systems Design Engineering</a> student at the University of Waterloo from Toronto, ON. I'm interested in
                the intersection of tech, entrepreneurship, human systems, and data. </p>

            <p>I love bringing ideas to life through design thinking, collaborating with others at hackathons, and advocating
                for digital literacy.</p>

            <p>I dabble in a little bit of everything: web-development, design, ux/ui design,
                <a href="https://www.medium.com/@mathurahravi">writing</a>, photography, entrepreneurship, and leadership. All and all, I love tech, and most specifically,
                how it can positively change our lives and make the world a better place. Things are changing every day and
                I want to be on the forefront of it. I'm forever curious and always learning no matter what. </p>

            <p>I was named a
                <a href="https://twitter.com/mathurahravi/status/1146467818310897664">Generation Google Scholar</a>, have done development at the Royal Bank of Canada, Product Design at a startup,
                Blockchain Markets (now acquired by Bit.buy) and help with content development at Canada Learning Code. </p>

            <p>I also co-founded and am Chief Product Officer of
                <a href="http://mycryptohippo.com">myCryptoHippo</a>, a cryptocurrency education platform that makes blockchain more accessible by allowing
                students to learn how to trade using virtual dollars. As head of product, I managed a team of 15 and allowed
                our team to win pitch competitions internationally. </p>

            <p>When I'm not designing, writing, or working on a new idea, you can find me playing on the ukulele, teaching kids
                how to code at Canada Learning Code, chasing after other people's dogs, or re-reading the Harry Potter series.
            </p>

            <p>Excited to expand my skills and provide value in any way!
                <p></p>

            <h2>ðŸ“Œ What I'm doing now</h1>

                <p>
                    <strong>Started University! ðŸ¤“</strong>
                </p>
                <p>I'm taking classes such as intro to design where we're learning about design-thinking, problem-solving, ideation.
                    In Digital Computation we're learning C++, Solidworks and CAD in our engineering visualization classes,
                    engineering ethics & communications, and of course, the classics: calculus, linear systems, and physics!</p>

                <p>I'm really loving what I'm learning, and overall taking everything in - essentially learning how to learn. I've taken some time to adjust to my first year, and I've gotten involved by attending Hack the North, UW/UX events, getting involved with the Alternative Fuel Energies car design team and modeling for the sustainable fashion show.</p>


                <strong>Content Development at Canada Learning Code ðŸ’¼</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Since April 2019 I've been working with Canada Learning Code on as a content developer to transform their
                    Teens Learning Code content. So far I've led a focus group, gathered research, and I'm now working on editing their arduino content! </p>
