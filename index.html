            <p>Hey! I'm Mathurah. I'm an incoming
                <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/systems-design-engineering/">Systems Design Engineering</a> student at the University of Waterloo from Toronto, ON. I'm interested in
                the intersection of tech, entrepreneurship, human systems, and data. </p>

            <p>I love bringing ideas to life through design thinking, collaborating with others at hackathons, and advocating
                for digital literacy.</p>

            <p>I dabble in a little bit of everything: web-development, design, ux/ui design,
                <a href="https://www.medium.com/@mathurahravi">writing</a>, photography, entrepreneurship, and leadership. All and all, I love tech, and most specifically,
                how it can positively change our lives and make the world a better place. Things are changing every day and
                I want to be on the forefront of it. I'm forever curious and always learning no matter what. </p>

            <p>I was named a
                <a href="https://twitter.com/mathurahravi/status/1146467818310897664">Generation Google Scholar</a>, have done development at the Royal Bank of Canada, Product Design at a startup,
                Blockchain Markets (now acquired by
                <a href="http://bit.buy">Bit.buy</a>) and help with content development at Canada Learning Code. </p>

            <p>I also co-founded and am Chief Product Officer of
                <a href="http://mycryptohippo.com">myCryptoHippo</a>, a cryptocurrency education platform that makes blockchain more accessible by allowing
                students to learn how to trade using virtual dollars. As head of product, I managed a team of 15 and allowed
                our team to win pitch competitions internationally. </p>

            <p>When I'm not designing, writing, or working on a new idea, you can find me playing on the ukulele, teaching kids
                how to code at Canada Learning Code, chasing after other people's dogs, or re-reading the Harry Potter series.
            </p>

            <p>Excited to expand my skills and provide value in any way!
                <p></p>

            <h2>üìå What I'm doing now</h1>
                <p>
                    <strong>Girls Make Games üéÆ</strong>
                </p>
                <p>In July, I went to Seattle and was a counselor at the Xbox camp for Girls Make Games as a part of their fellowship
                    program. I led a team of 4 girls aged 9-11 to build a fun animal platformer game within 3 weeks. Check
                    out our game
                    <a href="https://mathurahravigulan.itch.io/animal-mission">here</a>.</p>

                <p>This was an awesome experience not only getting the chance to go to the west coast for the first time but
                    being able to inspire young girls and reduce the gender gap in the gaming industry is amazing. These
                    girls are changing the game! I learned that accessible game design is something I'd love to explore in
                    the future. </p>

                <p>Blog post about what I learned is in the works ‚úç</p>

                    <strong>Content Development at Canada Learning Code üíº</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Since April 2019 I've been working with Canada Learning Code on as a content developer to transform their
                    Teens Learning Code content. So far I've led a focus group, gathered research, and I'm now working on
                    their HTML & CSS content. </p>

                <p><strong>Preparing for University ü§ì</strong></p>
                <p>So excited for my next adventure! Currently reviewing some math + physics, shopping for dorm room things, and saying bye to my friends in Toronto üò¢</p>
