            </p>
            <p>Hey! I'm Mathurah. I'm a
                <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/systems-design-engineering/">Systems Design Engineering</a> student at the University of Waterloo from Toronto, ON. I'm interested in
                the intersection of tech, entrepreneurship, human systems, and data. </p>

            <p>I love bringing ideas to life through design thinking, collaborating with others at hackathons, and advocating
                for digital literacy.</p>

            <p>I dabble in a little bit of everything: web-development, design, ux/ui design,
                <a href="https://www.medium.com/@mathurahravi">writing</a>, photography, entrepreneurship, and leadership. All and all, I love tech, and most specifically,
                how it can positively change our lives and make the world a better place. Things are changing every day and
                I want to be on the forefront of it. I'm forever curious and always learning no matter what. </p>

            <p>I was named a
                <a href="https://twitter.com/mathurahravi/status/1146467818310897664">Generation Google Scholar</a>, have done development at the Royal Bank of Canada, Product Design at a startup,
                Blockchain Markets (now acquired by Bit.buy) and help with content development at Canada Learning Code. </p>

            <p>I also co-founded and am Chief Product Officer of
                <a href="http://mycryptohippo.com">myCryptoHippo</a>, a cryptocurrency education platform that makes blockchain more accessible by allowing
                students to learn how to trade using virtual dollars. As head of product, I managed a team of 15 and allowed
                our team to win pitch competitions internationally. </p>

            <p>When I'm not designing, writing, or working on a new idea, you can find me playing on the ukulele, teaching kids
                how to code at Canada Learning Code, chasing after other people's dogs, or re-reading the Harry Potter series.
            </p>

            <p>Excited to expand my skills and provide value in any way!
                <p></p>

            <h2>ðŸ“Œ What I'm doing now</h2>

                <p>
                    <strong>Internship at Deloitte ðŸ’¼</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Working as a software developer for Deloitte's Insurance Innovation team. Doing a hybrid role - a little bit everything - my favourite part of consulting. I worked on a software architecture diagram for our application, developed a digital claims web-applicaiton using Angular and mapped user data to back-end services. </p>

                <p>I designed the front-end for our optical character recognition forms processing application in a tight two week timeline. I owned a full redesign of digital claims, conducting over 10 interviews with Insurance leaders at Deloitte to bring the product to life and test feasibility. This was an amazing opportunity - owning a whole project as an intern and seeing it's impact. After my designs were made, I went straight into implementation, and worked on developing the website for future client deployment. </p>


                <strong>Content Development at Canada Learning Code ðŸ’¼</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Since April 2019 I've been working with Canada Learning Code on as a content developer to transform their
                    Teens Learning Code content. So far I've led a focus group, gathered research, and I'm now working on editing their arduino content! </p>
